    <h1 id="aboutme">ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Chase Wilburn and I recently graduated from St. Charles Community College with an 
        Associates Degree in Web Design and Multimedia in 2021. As a web developer, I am passionate about creating modern and dyn
        amic websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. During my studies, I developed skills in various programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am eager to utilize these skills and knowledge to create responsive, accessible, and scalable web applications. 
        I am excited to work with clients to bring their ideas to life and help them establish an impactful online presence. In my free time,
         I enjoy tinkering on new projects, and learning more about coding.
    </p>
